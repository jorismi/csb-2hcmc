But I understimated the scale and ended up with almost invisibles tinies planets and enormous Sun. </p> <p> That's why I made an "artistic view" where the scale isn't accurate but with a more readable solar system . However, in both view, the Sun is a lot smaller than in reality. </p> <button class="modal-close modal-exit">X</button> </div> </div> <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>  <button class="toggleViewTypeBtn" id="toggleViewTypeBtn"> Switch to <span id="viewType">realistic</span> view </button> <div class="yearCounter"> <span id="yearCounterNumber">0</span> <span id="yearCounterText">Earth year</span> </div> </body></html>
